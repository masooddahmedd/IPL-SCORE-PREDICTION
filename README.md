# IPL Score Prediction

This project aims to predict IPL (Indian Premier League) cricket match scores using machine learning techniques. You can explore the dataset and model by following the instructions below.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is available in the `ipl.csv` file in this repository. It contains historical IPL match data, including features like team batting and bowling statistics, venue details, and more. This dataset is used to train and evaluate the prediction model.

## Model

The prediction model is implemented in a Jupyter Notebook (`ipl_score_prediction.ipynb`) that is also included in this repository. You can open and run the notebook to explore the model, its implementation, and the prediction results.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/masooddahmedd/IPL-SCORE-PREDICTION.git
